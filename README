Team 3 Idiots' approach for Display Advertising Challenge
=========================================================

This README introduces how to run our code up. For the introduction to our
approach, please see docs/slide.pdf. 


System Requirement
==================

- 64-bit Unix-like operating system (We tested our code on Ubuntu 13.10)

- Python3

- g++ (with C++11 support)

- at least 20GB memory and 50GB disk space


Step-by-step
============

1. Copy the training and test data to this directory, and rename them as
   "tr.csv" and "te.csv", respectively.

2. Run the following command to prepare excutables and csv files. It may take
   several minutes because we add a dummy label to the test file.
    
     $ make

3. Run the following command to generate a prediction.

     $ run.py

   The final output file is "submission.csv".


Miscellaneous
=============

1. By default we use only one thread, so it may take a long time to train the
   model. If you have multi-core CPUs, you may want to modify "NR_THREAD" in
   the script. On our machine with two six-core CPUs (intel E5-2620), it takes
   around 3.5 hours when all cores are used.

2. Our algorithms is non-deterministic when multiple threads are used. (That
   is, the results can be slightly different when you run the script two or
   more times.) In our experience, the variances generally do not exceed
   0.0001 (LogLoss).

3. This script generates around a prediction with around 0.44490 / 0.44480 on
   public / private leaderboards. If you want the prediction with around
   0.44460 / 0.44450, please change:

     ./gbdt -t 30        --->         ./gbdt -t 50  

     ./fm -k 4 -t 11     --->         ./fm -k 8 -t 15

   Training with this setting takes around 9 hours on our machine.
