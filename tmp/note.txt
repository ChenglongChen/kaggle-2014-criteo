baseline 30 trees, k = 8, lambda = 0.00001 


[lambda]
lambda = 0.000009   0.44479
lambda = 0.000011   0.44480
lambda = 0.000012   0.44480

[k]
for r100 and r10, k = 4 is enough; for r1, k = 8 is 0.00001 better than k = 4

[depth] t50,k8,r10
3   0.45569
4   0.45548
5   0.45563
6   0.45558
7   0.45551

but the results seems different on r1..
4   0.44492
5   0.44480
